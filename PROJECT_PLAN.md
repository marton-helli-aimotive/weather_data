# Weather Data Engineering Project - Development Plan

## Project Overview

This project transforms a basic weather data collection script into a comprehensive, production-ready data engineering pipeline. The system will collect data from multiple weather APIs, process it using modern Python tools, provide interactive visualizations, and deploy as a containerized application with full monitoring and CI/CD.

## Development Strategy

### Optimal Development Order
The milestones are designed to:
1. **Build solid foundations first** - Establish development environment and architecture patterns
2. **Implement core functionality incrementally** - API clients, data processing, visualization
3. **Add quality assurance throughout** - Testing alongside feature development
4. **Deploy and document last** - Production deployment and comprehensive documentation

### Risk Mitigation Approach
- **Early validation** of API integrations and data quality
- **Parallel development** where possible (testing alongside features)
- **Incremental delivery** enabling early feedback and course correction
- **Fallback strategies** for API failures and external dependencies

## Milestone Summary

| Milestone | Duration | Dependencies | Risk Level |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 1. Foundation & Architecture | 3-4 days | None | Low |
| 2. Enhanced API Client | 5-6 days | M1 | Medium |
| 3. Data Processing & Analytics | 6-7 days | M2 | Medium |
| 4. Dashboard & Visualization | 5-6 days | M3 | Medium |
| 5. Testing Strategy | 4-5 days | M1-M3 | Low |
| 6. Containerization & Deployment | 4-5 days | M1-M5 | Medium |
| 7. Documentation & Integration | 3-4 days | M1-M6 | Low |

**Total Estimated Duration: 30-37 days**

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: For testability and modularity
- **Factory Pattern**: For API provider selection
- **Circuit Breaker**: For resilient external API calls
- **Producer/Consumer**: For real-time data processing

### Technology Stack
- **Core**: Python 3.11+, asyncio, aiohttp
- **Data**: Polars, pandas, Apache Arrow
- **Validation**: Pydantic v2 with comprehensive models
- **Testing**: pytest, Hypothesis, unittest.mock
- **Deployment**: Podman, podman-compose
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging, health checks

### Performance Strategy
- **Async-first approach** for I/O operations
- **Polars over pandas** for large dataset processing
- **Apache Arrow** for columnar data efficiency
- **Redis caching** for frequently accessed data
- **Connection pooling** for API clients

## Identified Risks & Mitigations

### Medium Risk Items
1. **API Rate Limits & Availability**
   - Mitigation: Multiple providers, circuit breakers, caching
   
2. **Complex Data Processing Performance**
   - Mitigation: Benchmarking, profiling, algorithm optimization
   
3. **Real-time Dashboard Performance**
   - Mitigation: Efficient updates, caching, performance monitoring

### Low Risk Items
- Development environment setup
- Testing framework implementation
- Documentation creation

## Critical Dependencies

### External Services
- Weather API providers (7timer, OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI)
  - 7timer key is: not required
  - WeatherAPI key is: 0e919c6354e74601a7b131057251508
  - OpenWeatherMap key is: currently unavailable
- Redis for caching (can be mocked for development)

### Development Requirements
- Python 3.11+ environment
- Container runtime (Podman/Docker)
- Development tools (git, pre-commit hooks)

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: >90% with meaningful tests
- **API Response Time**: <2s average for data retrieval
- **Dashboard Load Time**: <3s for initial page load
- **Container Image Size**: <500MB optimized production image

### Quality Metrics
- **Type Safety**: 100% mypy compliance
- **Code Quality**: All pre-commit hooks passing
- **Documentation**: Complete API docs and user guides
- **Deployment**: One-command deployment to production

## Potential Ambiguities & Clarifications Needed

### Scope Clarifications
1. **Dashboard Authentication**: Should this include user registration or just login? Answer: just login
2. **Data Persistence**: Do we need long-term data storage (database) or in-memory is sufficient? Answer: long-term data storage
3. **Real-time Requirements**: What's the acceptable delay for "real-time" updates? Answer: Up to you
4. **API Rate Limits**: Should we implement paid API tiers or focus on free tiers? Answer: free

### Technical Decisions
1. **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL, SQLite, or just in-memory storage? Answer: PostgreSQL
2. **Dashboard Framework**: Streamlit vs Dash - any preference? Answer: Dash
3. **Deployment Target**: Local containers only or cloud deployment needed? Answer: local
4. **Monitoring Level**: Basic health checks or full observability stack? Answer: basic

### Feature Priorities
1. Which advanced features from `bonus_tasks.md` should be included in scope? Answer: None yet
2. Should machine learning predictions be included or kept as future enhancement? Answer: Not yet
3. How comprehensive should the geospatial analysis be? Answer: Basic

## Next Steps

1. **Await approval** of this milestone plan
2. **Clarify ambiguities** listed above
3. **Begin Milestone 1** - Foundation & Architecture Setup
4. **Regular progress reviews** after each milestone

This plan balances comprehensive feature delivery with practical development timelines, ensuring a production-ready system while maintaining code quality and proper testing throughout.
