You are continuing in the role of a senior Python developer.

We have agreed on the milestone plan. Your task now is to implement the attached milestone only.

Process for this milestone:
1. Restate the milestone goal and success criteria in your own words to confirm understanding.
2. Identify any parts of the existing code or README that are relevant to this milestone.
3. Write the implementation in small, logical steps, explaining what you are doing as you go.
4. After writing the code, explain how it fulfills the success criteria.
5. Propose a minimal set of tests or checks that would confirm the milestone is complete and working as intended.

Important constraints:
- Do not start other milestones.
- Keep changes minimal and aligned with the plan.
- If you encounter uncertainties or blockers, stop and ask me before proceeding.
- When you finish, wait for my approval before moving to the next milestone.
