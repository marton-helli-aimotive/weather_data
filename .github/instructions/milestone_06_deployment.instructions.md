# Milestone 6: Containerization & Deployment

## Objective
Create a complete deployment strategy with Podman containerization, orchestration with podman-compose, health monitoring, and CI/CD pipeline for production-ready deployment.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Multi-stage Containerfile optimized for production
- [ ] podman-compose setup for local development environment
- [ ] Health checks and graceful shutdown implemented
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration management
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with automated deployment
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting system configured
- [ ] Complete deployment documentation

## Key Tasks

### 6.1 Container Strategy
- **Multi-stage Containerfile**:
  - Use official Python slim images
  - Separate build and runtime stages
  - Optimize layer caching for faster builds
  - Security hardening (non-root user, minimal attack surface)
  - Include health check endpoints
- **Image Optimization**:
  - Minimize final image size
  - Use .containerignore for build efficiency
  - Layer optimization for caching
  - Security scanning integration

### 6.2 Local Development Environment
- **podman-compose Configuration**:
  - Multi-service setup (app, redis, database)
  - Development vs production configurations
  - Volume mounts for code development
  - Environment variable management
  - Network configuration between services
- **Development Workflow**:
  - Hot reload for development
  - Database seeding and migration
  - Log aggregation setup
  - Debug configuration

### 6.3 Production Deployment
- **Health & Monitoring**:
  - Implement health check endpoints
  - Add readiness and liveness probes
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Resource usage monitoring
  - Performance metrics collection
- **Configuration Management**:
  - Environment-specific settings
  - Secrets management (API keys, passwords)
  - Feature flag support
  - Runtime configuration updates

### 6.4 CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
  - Automated testing on pull requests
  - Code quality checks (linting, type checking)
  - Security vulnerability scanning
  - Automated container builds
  - Deployment automation
- **Pipeline Stages**:
  - Code quality validation
  - Test execution (unit, integration, e2e)
  - Container image building and scanning
  - Deployment to staging/production
  - Rollback capabilities

### 6.5 Monitoring & Alerting
- **Application Monitoring**:
  - Structured logging with JSON format
  - Metrics collection (Prometheus-compatible)
  - Error tracking and alerting
  - Performance monitoring
  - Resource usage tracking
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**:
  - Container resource usage
  - API response times and error rates
  - Database performance metrics
  - Cache hit/miss ratios
  - External API availability

### 6.6 Documentation & Operations
- **Deployment Documentation**:
  - Setup and configuration guide
  - Troubleshooting procedures
  - Scaling recommendations
  - Backup and recovery procedures
  - Security best practices
- **Operational Procedures**:
  - Deployment checklist
  - Rollback procedures
  - Monitoring playbooks
  - Incident response guide

## Dependencies
- All previous milestones (1-5)

## Risk Factors
- **Medium risk**: Container orchestration complexity
- **Low risk**: Standard deployment practices
- Potential issue: Environment-specific configuration issues

## Estimated Duration
4-5 days

## Deliverables
- Production-ready containerized application
- Complete local development environment
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Monitoring and alerting system
- Comprehensive deployment documentation
- Operational runbooks and procedures
