# M14 â€“ Documentation and performance report

Goal: Comprehensive docs (README, ADRs, API docs) and performance/scale analysis.

In-scope
- Architecture overview and ADRs for key decisions.
- API docs (FastAPI/Sphinx outline), user/developer guides.
- Benchmark results and tuning notes.

Out-of-scope
- Full website; focus on repo docs.

Deliverables
- Documentation plan and report template.

Success criteria
- New contributor can run, test, and extend; perf report supports claims.

Depends on: Most milestones
Risks
- Docs drift. Mitigation: doc-as-code and CI checks.

Open questions
- Any compliance or reporting format requirements?
