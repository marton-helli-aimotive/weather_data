# Milestone 4: Interactive Dashboard & Visualization

## Objective
Create a comprehensive, real-time dashboard with interactive visualizations, user authentication, and export capabilities using modern visualization libraries.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Real-time dashboard with live data updates
- [ ] Interactive plots with zoom, pan, and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Geographic visualizations (heatmaps, choropleth maps)
- [ ] 3D surface plots for multi-dimensional data
- [ ] Animated visualizations showing temporal evolution
- [ ] User authentication and session management
- [ ] Export functionality (PDF, Excel reports)
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Key Tasks

### 4.1 Dashboard Framework Setup
- Choose between Streamlit and Dash (recommend Streamlit for rapid development)
- Set up application structure and routing
- Implement responsive layout design
- Add custom CSS styling
- Configure application state management

### 4.2 Interactive Visualizations
- **Time Series Plots**: 
  - Temperature, humidity, wind speed over time
  - Multiple cities comparison
  - Zoom and pan capabilities
  - Data point annotations
- **Geographic Visualizations**:
  - World map with weather data overlay
  - Heatmaps showing temperature/precipitation patterns
  - Choropleth maps for regional comparisons
  - Interactive markers for city selection
- **3D Visualizations**:
  - Surface plots for temperature/pressure relationships
  - 3D scatter plots for multi-dimensional analysis
  - Interactive rotation and zoom

### 4.3 Real-time Features
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Auto-refresh mechanisms for data
- Real-time alerts for extreme weather
- Live data streaming indicators
- Performance optimized updates

### 4.4 Advanced Dashboard Features
- **Animation Support**:
