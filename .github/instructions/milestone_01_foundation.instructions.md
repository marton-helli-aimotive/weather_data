# Milestone 1: Foundation & Architecture Setup

## Objective
Establish the project foundation with proper development environment, code quality tools, and core architecture patterns.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Development environment configured with all required dependencies
- [ ] Code quality tools (pre-commit, linting, formatting) working
- [ ] Project structure follows modern Python best practices
- [ ] Type hints with mypy compliance achieved
- [ ] Basic logging and configuration management implemented
- [ ] Dependency injection patterns established

## Key Tasks

### 1.1 Project Setup & Dependencies
- Set up `uv` for dependency management (replace pip/poetry)
- Create comprehensive `pyproject.toml` with all required dependencies
- Configure development dependencies (testing, linting, formatting)
- Set up virtual environment with Python 3.11+

### 1.2 Code Quality Infrastructure
- Configure `pre-commit` hooks with:
  - `black` for code formatting
  - `isort` for import sorting  
  - `ruff` as fast linter (replace flake8)
  - `mypy` for type checking
- Set up `.gitignore` for Python projects
- Create `pyproject.toml` configuration for all tools

### 1.3 Project Structure
- Organize code into logical modules:
  - `src/weather_pipeline/` (main package)
  - `src/weather_pipeline/api/` (API clients)
  - `src/weather_pipeline/models/` (data models)
  - `src/weather_pipeline/processing/` (data processing)
  - `src/weather_pipeline/config/` (configuration)
  - `tests/` (test suite)
  - `docs/` (documentation)

### 1.4 Configuration Management
- Implement Pydantic-based settings management
- Support environment-specific configurations
- Add secure secrets handling (API keys, etc.)
- Create configuration validation

### 1.5 Logging & Monitoring Setup  
- Implement structured JSON logging
- Set up different log levels for environments
- Add basic metrics collection points
- Create logging configuration

## Dependencies
- None (foundation milestone)

## Risk Factors
- **Low risk**: Standard setup tasks
- Potential issue: Tool configuration conflicts

## Estimated Duration
3-4 days

## Deliverables
- Working development environment
- Configured code quality tools
- Basic project structure
- Configuration and logging systems
- Documentation on setup process
