# Milestone 2: Enhanced API Client & Data Models

## Objective
Upgrade the basic API client to a robust, multi-provider system with proper error handling, rate limiting, and comprehensive data validation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Multi-API support (7timer, OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) with unified interface
- [ ] Robust error handling with circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Rate limiting and retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Comprehensive Pydantic models for all API responses
- [ ] Data source factory pattern implemented
- [ ] API client thoroughly tested with mocks

## Key Tasks

### 2.1 Enhanced Data Models
- Expand `WeatherDataPoint` model with all weather attributes
- Create provider-specific response models
- Add validation for data quality (ranges, required fields)
- Implement schema evolution handling
- Add data lineage tracking fields

### 2.2 API Client Architecture
- Create abstract base class for weather providers
- Implement concrete classes for each API:
  - `SevenTimerClient`
  - `OpenWeatherMapClient` 
  - `WeatherAPIClient`
- Add factory pattern for provider selection
- Implement unified response interface

### 2.3 Advanced Error Handling
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- API-specific error codes handling
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Comprehensive logging for failures

### 2.4 Rate Limiting & Performance
- Advanced rate limiting per API provider
- Connection pooling optimization
- Request batching where supported
- Caching strategies for repeated requests
- Performance monitoring and metrics

### 2.5 API Response Processing
- Robust parsing for each provider's format
- Data normalization and standardization  
- Timestamp handling across timezones
- Unit conversion utilities
- Data quality validation at ingestion

## Dependencies
- Milestone 1 (Foundation & Architecture Setup)

## Risk Factors
- **Medium risk**: API rate limits and availability
- **Medium risk**: Provider-specific quirks and edge cases
- Potential issue: API schema changes during development

## Estimated Duration
5-6 days

## Deliverables
- Multi-provider API client system
- Comprehensive data models
- Error handling and resilience features
- Unit and integration tests
- API client documentation
