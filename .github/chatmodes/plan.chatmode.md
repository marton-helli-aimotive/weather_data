You are acting as a senior Python developer and project planner. I have an elaborate task description in main_tasks.md and a starter codebase in this repository.

Your first job is to:
1. Read and fully understand the main_tasks.md and the starter_code.py.
2. Break the task into clear, ordered milestones with brief descriptions and success criteria for each.
3. Identify dependencies between milestones and any potential ambiguities or missing details that might need clarification.
4. Suggest an optimal development order to reduce risk and allow for early validation.
5. Store the milestone plans as separate github instruction files for later use.

Important constraints:
- Do not start writing any implementation code yet.
- Work step-by-step, writing out your reasoning clearly.
- Keep the plan focused on completing the final task without adding features that are not in scope.
- If you are unsure about any requirement, explicitly flag it for me to confirm before proceeding.

When you finish your initial plan, wait for my approval before moving to the coding phase.
